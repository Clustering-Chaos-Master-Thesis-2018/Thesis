@article{Yick2008-wsn-survey,
abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lee2007-capture-effect,
abstract = {In wireless networks, a frame collision does not necessarily result in all the simultaneously transmitted frames being lost. Depending on the relative signal power and the arrival timing of the involved frames, one frame can survive the collision and be successfully received by the receiver. Using our IEEE 802.11a wireless network testbed, we carry out a measurement study that shows the terms and conditions (timing, power difference, bit rate) under which this capture effect takes place. Recent measurement work on the capture effect in 802.11 networks [10] argues that the stronger frame can be successfully decoded only in two cases: (1) The stronger frame arrives earlier than the weaker frame, or (2) the stronger frame arrives later than the weaker frame but within the preamble time of the weaker frame. However, our measurement shows that the stronger frame can be decoded correctly regardless of the timing relation with the weaker frame. In addition, when the stronger frame arrives later than the weaker frame's arrival, the physical layer capture exhibits two very distinct patterns based on whether the receiver has been successfully synchronized to the previous weak frame or not. In explaining the distinct cases we observe that the successful capture of a frame involved in a collision is determined through two stages: preamble detection and the frame body FCS check.},

@article{Afsar2014-clustering-survey,
abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently gained the attention of researchers in many challenging aspects. The most important challenge in these networks is energy conservation. One of the most popular solutions in making WSNs energy-efficient is to cluster the networks. In clustering, the nodes are divided into some clusters and then some nodes, called cluster-heads, are selected to be the head of each cluster. In a typical clustered WSN, the regular nodes sense the field and send their data to the cluster-head, then, after gathering and aggregating the data, the cluster-head transmits them to the base station. Clustering the nodes in WSNs has many benefits, including scalability, energy-efficiency, and reducing routing delay. In this paper we present a state-of-the-art and comprehensive survey on clustering approaches. We first begin with the objectives of clustering, clustering characteristics, and then present a classification on the clustering algorithms in WSNs. Some of the clustering objectives considered in this paper include scalability, fault-tolerance, data aggregation/fusion, increased connectivity, load balancing, and collision avoidance. Then, we survey the proposed approaches in the past few years in a classified manner and compare them based on different metrics such as mobility, cluster count, cluster size, and algorithm complexity.},

In this paper, we propose a novel distributed clustering approach for long-lived ad hoc sensor networks. Our proposed approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in Oð1Þ iterations, incurs low message overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. We prove that, with appropriate bounds on node density and intracluster and intercluster transmission ranges, HEED can asymptotically almost surely guarantee connectivity of clustered networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting scalable data aggregation},

@article{Li2005-EEUC,
abstract = {Clustering provides an effective way for prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. Current clustering algorithms usually utilize two techniques, selecting cluster heads with more residual energy and rotating cluster heads periodically, to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and extend the network lifetime. However, they rarely consider the hot spots problem in multihop wireless sensor networks. When cluster heads cooperate with each other to forward their data to the base station, the cluster heads closer to the base station are burdened with heavy relay traffic and tend to die early, leaving areas of the network uncovered and causing network partition. To address the problem, we propose an energy-efficient unequal clustering (EEUC) mechanism for periodical data gathering in wireless sensor networks. It partitions the nodes into clusters of unequal size, and clusters closer to the base station have smaller sizes than those farther away from the base station. Thus cluster heads closer to the base station can preserve some energy for the inter-cluster data forwarding. We also propose an energy-aware multihop routing protocol for the inter-cluster communication. Simulation results show that our unequal clustering mechanism balances the energy consumption well among all sensor nodes and achieves an obvious improvement on the network lifetime},

@article{Mahmood2015-reliability-survey,
abstract = {Ensuring energy efficient and reliable transport of data in resource constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is one of the primary concerns to achieve a high degree of efficiency in monitoring and control systems. The two techniques typically used in WSNs to achieve reliability are either retransmission or redundancy. Most of the existing research focuses on traditional retransmission-based reliability, where reliable transmission of data packets is ensured in terms of recovering the lost packets by retransmitting them. This might result in additional transmission overhead that not only wastes sensors' limited energy resources but also makes the network congested and in turn affects the reliable transmission of data. On the other hand, employing redundancy to achieve reliability in WSNs has received comparatively lesser emphasis by the research community [35] and this area warrants further investigation. In redundancy-based reliability mechanisms, a bit loss within a packet can be recovered by utilizing some form of coding schemes. This ability to correct the lost or corrupted bits within a packet would significantly reduce the transmission overhead caused by the retransmission of the entire packet. Both retransmission and redundancy can either be performed on a hop-by-hop or an end-to-end basis. Hop-by-hop method allows the intermediate nodes to perform retransmission or redundancy. On the other hand, in the end-to-end approach, retransmission or redundancy is performed only at the source and the destination nodes. However, a hybrid mechanism with an efficient combination of these retransmission and redundancy techniques in order to achieve reliability has so far been neglected by the existing research. Depending on the nature of the application, it is also important to define the amount of data required to ensure reliability. This introduces the concept of packet or event level reliability. Packet reliability requires all the packets from all the relevant sensor nodes to reach the sink, whereas event reliability ensures that the sink only gets enough information about a certain event happening. Thus retransmission or redundancy techniques using hop-by-hop or end-to-end mechanisms aim to achieve either packet or event level reliability. This paper presents a survey on reliability protocols in WSNs. We review several reliability schemes based on retransmission and redundancy techniques using different combinations of packet or event reliability in terms of recovering the lost data using hop-by-hop or end-to-end mechanisms. We further analyze these schemes by investigating the most suitable combination of these techniques, methods and required reliability level in order to provide energy efficient reliability mechanism for resource constrained WSNs. This paper also proposes a 3D reference model for classifying research in WSN reliability, which will be used to perform in-depth analysis of the unexplored areas.},

FlockLab's accurate timing information in the low microsecond range enables logical events to be correlated with power samples, thus providing a previously unattained level of visibility into the distributed behavior of wireless embedded systems.

@article{Perillo2005-hot-spot-survey,
abstract = {In multi-hop wireless sensor networks that are characterized by many-to-one (converge-east) traffic patterns, problems related to energy imbalance among sensors often appear. When the transmission range is fixed for nodes throughout the network, the amount of traffic that sensors are required to forward increases dramatically as the distance to the data sink becomes smaller. Thus, sensors closest to the data sink tend to die early. Network lifetime can be improved to a limited extent by the use of a more intelligent transmission power control policy that balances the energy used in each node by requiring nodes further from the data sink to transmit over longer distances (although not directly to the data sink). Alternatively, policies such as data aggregation allow the network to operate in a more energy efficient manner. Since the deployment of an aggregator node may be significantly more expensive than the deployment of an ordinary microsensor node, there is a cost tradeoff involved in this approach. This paper provides an analysis of these policies for mitigating the sensor network hot spot problem, considering energy efficiency as well as cost efficiency.},
